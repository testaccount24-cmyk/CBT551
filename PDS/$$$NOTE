Re:  Your Post

  I had a similar problem a while back before Top Secret fully
  supported the TSO segment.  The CONSOLE (and CONSPROF)
  authorities are picked up from the "RACF" TSO segment.  The
  alternative is to set them via the IKJCNXAC and IKJCNXCI exits.
  I hae working copies of both these exits that set the CONSOLE
  and CONSPROF authority bits if the user also has the OPERATOR
  authority set (if they have one, they might as well have the
  other).  I used these until Top Secret fully supported the TSO
  segment.

  If anyone wants a copy of these exits I will email them if you
  send a private email.
